# Fine-Tuning Socratic Fact-Checking Models

This repository contains the code used to **fine-tune quantized large language models** for generating **Socratic-style questions** in the context of **journalistic fact-checking**.

Specifically, the project focuses on fine-tuning:

- **LLaMA 3.1 (8B, quantized)**
- **Mistral 7B (quantized)**

The fine-tuning process was implemented using the **Unsloth** library, enabling efficient training on consumer-grade hardware and cloud environments.

The resulting models were designed to support **critical reflection** during fact-checking workflows and were subsequently integrated into the **CheckMate** multi-agent assistant.

## 📚 FACTors Dataset

Training and evaluation data were grounded in **real-world fact-checking claims** from the **FACTors project**, a large-scale dataset for studying the fact-checking ecosystem.

- FACTors GitHub repository:  
  👉 https://github.com/altuncu/FACTors

Synthetic training data was generated by transforming FACTors claims into **Socratic questions**, enabling the models to learn reflective, pedagogically oriented questioning behavior.

## 🧠 Purpose of the Models

The fine-tuned models are intended to:

- Generate **critical, reflective questions** during fact-checking
- Encourage **methodological transparency**
- Support **journalism education**, rather than automate verdicts

These models were evaluated against strong instruct baselines to assess improvements in **question quality, pedagogical alignment, and latency**.
